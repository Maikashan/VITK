# TODO

In this project, we must document everything. We need to write who did what
in the code and in the doc. Here is the bareme:

```
Ex√©cution du code : 2.5
Documentation : 2.5
Partie Recalage : 5
Partie Segmentation : 5
Partie Visualisation : 5
```

The code must be run with a simple:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

And launch the analyse part as well as the Visualisation part

## ITK Part

### Recalage

Looks like the first step, multiple possible strategy

### Segmentation

The teacher want us to try multiple things to get the best possible results, we
must titerate in this part. We can use a user input, but it must be harcoded in the end

### Comparison

We are free to do many things, we have some examples, must go further

## VTK Part

This part will be evaluated with the comparison one. We have some work to do
to render it user friendly
